# Orlang

Update: 11/21/2022 (Mid-term project Hello-World Submission)

## 1. File Structure
- `ast.mli`: Orlang's AST and SAST definitions
- `scanner.mll`: Orlang's Scanner
- `parser.mly`: Orlang's Parser
- `semant.ml`: Orlang's semantic checking. Currently checks for type errors (via Algorithm W) and unused variables
- `unification.ml`: Unification module used in Algorithm W
- `instantiation.ml`: 
- `cgen.ml`: Orlang's (very rough) codegen subroutines for generating C code from Orlang.
- `Makefile`: For your convenience when running tests
- `tests/`: Testcases for Orlang

## 2. Running Orlang on tests
First, build orlang via
```
$ ocamlbuild orlang.native > orlang

# alternatively...
$ make build
```
in the root directory. Then, run
```
$ orlang < tests/test{n}.orl > tests/test{n}.out.c

# to run this for ALL testcases,
$ make test
```
where `n` is the testcase number.

You can either `cat tests/test{n}.out.c` or compile it with `gcc` and then run the executable

## 3. Features Implemented
Below are some noteworthy features we have implemented so far:
- **Lambdas**: We support lambdas (anonymous functions):
  ```
  let five =
    let f = (\x y -> 1 * (x - 2) * y) in 
    let g x y = x * y in
    let x = 3 in
    let y = 4 in
    f (g x 2 - 3) ((\z -> z + 1) y)
  ```

- **Type System**: We have implemented a very basic Hindly-Milner type system via Algorithm W. We can infer
  types and check for type errors. Do support this, we have also implemented a `unification` module.

- **Type Annotations**: We support type annotations, which is incorporated into our HM type system.
  ```
  val add : Int -> Int -> Int
  let add x y = (x : Int) + (y : Int)

  val subtract : Int -> Int -> Int
  let subtract x y = x - y : Int
  ```

- **Recursion**: We support recursive functions:
  ```
  val fac : Int -> Int
  let rec fac n = 
    if n == 0 then 0
    else if n == 1 then 1
    else (fac (n - 1)) + (fac (n - 2))

  (* non-recursive functions can't be defined with the `rec` keyword; the following fails *)
  let rec x = 1
  ```

- **Pattern Matching front-end**: We have implemented pattern matching at the scanning/parsing level. The following describes a
  use case:
  ```
  let example (x : Int) =
    match x with
    | 0 = 1
    | _ = 0;
  ```

- **Very rough C codegen**: We can generate `C` code from Orlang. This is just for a placeholder, and we assume
it will help us transition into LLVM land as we begin implementing the backend.


## 4. Features in progress or to be implemented
- **Desugaring Pattern Matching**: While we have defined how pattern matching
should behave at the scanner/parser level, we are still working on its desugaring. We have begun writing
a very primitive desugaring algorithm (e.g. nested `if-then-else`), we may consider more efficient
compilation methods (e.g. decision trees) if time permits. 

- **Semantically Checking Pattern Matching**: We are also implementing anomaly detection (nonexhaustion and useless clause).

- **Algebraic Data Types**: We hope to support algebraic data types (union and product types) 

- **List and Tuples**: We need proper support for list and tuples

- **Parallelism**: We are currently doing discovery work on how to support parallelism (stateless, to being with)
in the LLVM setting.

- **Message Passing Concurrency**: We are also doing discovery on how to support message passing concurrency (lock-free).
We envision building a runtime library implementing bidirectional message queues.

## 5. Major changes to LRM
We have made no significant changes to our LRM. Included in the submission is our updated LRM with minor modifications.

## 6. Breakdown of Contributions
Everyone participated in formally defining our language (and thus our AST, scanner, parser); high-level discussions to solidfy our language featuers; and our approaches to implementing them. 

- Andrei: Implemented bulk of the parser. Implemented our unification module and Algorithm W for our Hindly Milner Type System; Implemented support for type annotations; Implemented the `C` codegen to translate Orlang to `C`. Writing testcases for Orlang. 

- Christopher: Wrote scanner and implemented semantic checking based on Andrei's type system work. Wrote initial unification and union-find module with Chris which was deprecated (we decided to use Andrei's implemention of substituion-based unification and HM type system). Implenting support for pattern matching, as well as pattern matching anomaly detection. Did refactoring to integrate teammates' work.

- Eumin: Writing testcases for Orlang. Wrote initial unification and union-find module with Chris which was deprecated (we decided to use Andrei's implemention of substituion-based unification and HM type system). Discovery work on ADTs and List & Tuple desugaring. Wrote testcases for orlang. 

- Scott and Alan: Working on a draft implementation of bidrectional message queues (via unix domain sockets) as a runtime C library. Discovery work on incorporating thread-based parallelism in the LLVM setting and the actor-model for message passing concurrency. Wrote testcases for orlang. 

## 7. Test Cases
We give a high-level description of the test-cases we wrote.
- `test1.orl`: Monomorphism; non-recursive let bindings; lambdas; multi-variable lambdas; nested comments; function application; currying; `where` clause desugaring

- `test2.orl`: Monomorphism; non-recursive let bindings

- `test3.orl`: booleans, and, or, not, if statement 

- `test4.orl`: Let polymorphism; recursive let bindings used polymorphically outside of their definition and monomorphically inside of their definition; redundant recursion

- `test5.orl`: Type annotations

- `test{6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17}.orl`: Unification errors (e.g. type errors)

- `test8.orl`: Semantic errors (undefined variable)

- `test9.orl`: Error (infinite functions)

- `test10.orl`: Example of pattern matching

- `test16.orl`: Illegal recursion
